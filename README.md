# leaflet-challenge

This project visualizes earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using Leaflet. The goal is to educate the public and government organizations about seismic activity and its issues facing our planet.

The interactive map dynamically fetches live earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON feed. Markers represent earthquake locations, scaled by magnitude (size) and colored by depth. Popups provide additional information, including the location, magnitude, and depth of each earthquake. A legend is included to explain depth color coding. By using real-time data, the map always reflects the most recent earthquake activity.

Features:
- Dynamic fetching of earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON feed.
- Markers scaled by earthquake magnitude and colored by depth.
- Interactive popups showing location, magnitude, and depth.
- Legend to explain depth color coding.
